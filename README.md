# Dog-Breed-Identifier
Built a Convolutional Neural Network model that identifies dog breeds by combining powerful pre-processing, CNN-based feature extraction, and post-processing for accurate and interpretable predictions.


Developed a hybrid deep learning model combining ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures using TensorFlow to accurately classify 120 dog breeds from images.
